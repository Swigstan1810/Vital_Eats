1\. Project Overview 

1. Project Objectives 

Vital Eats aims to develop an advanced, user centric tool for analysing food nutritional data. The tool will allow users to search for food items from a comprehensive food database and visualize their nutritional content, focusing on key metrics such as calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates. By offering clear and accessible data visualizations, Vital Eats will empower users to make healthier and more informed dietary choices, promoting better nutritional awareness and assisting individuals in planning balanced diets. 

2. Project Stakeholders 

Primary Stakeholders: 

- Development Team (Group 32 Members): 

The three members of Group 32 are responsible for the complete project lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and documentation. Each member will take on specific roles while also collaborating on key tasks. 

- Team Members: 

S5232738: Drishti Madaan, Project Manager & Backend Developer S5364886: Laven Vinod Patel, Lead Developer & Frontend Developer S5362233: Shubham, Data Analyst & Tester 

- End Users: 

Healthconscious individuals, fitness enthusiasts, and nutrition focused users who seek to analyse and visualize food nutritional data for personal use. The tool will be designed with these users in mind, ensuring it is intuitive and meets their needs. 

- Secondary Stakeholders: 
1) Nutritionists/Dietitians: 

Professionals who might use the Vital Eats tool to assist clients with dietary guidance, nutritional education, and meal planning. Their insights could help refine the tool’s features for professional use, making it an asset in clinical or advisory settings. 

2) Potential Investors: 

Companies like MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Noom, and HealthifyMe may be interested in Vital Eats for integration into their platforms or as a potential acquisition to enhance their offerings. These stakeholders could influence the tool's scalability and market positioning. 

3) Academic Institutions: 

Universities and research bodies focusing on nutrition, dietetics, or public health could use Vital Eats for research purposes or as an educational tool. Their feedback could be crucial in ensuring the tool meets academic and research standards. 

3. Project Scope 
1. In Scope: 
- Development of the Vital Eats Nutritional Analysis Tool: Utilizing a reliable and comprehensive food database, the tool will be designed and developed to meet user needs. 
- Design and Implementation of an Intuitive Interface: The user interface will be 

  userfriendly, allowing for easy food searches and data visualization. 

- Creation of Visual Representations: Interactive charts and graphs will display nutritional data in a clear and informative manner. 
- User Testing: Extensive user testing will ensure the tool meets the needs of the target audience and is free from major issues or bugs. 
2. Out of Scope: 
- Personalized Meal Plans: Creation of customized meal plans tailored to individual users’ preferences or health goals is beyond the current scope. 
- Realtime Updates or Synchronization: Continuous updates or synchronization with external food databases are not included in this phase. 
- Integration with External Health Tracking Apps: The current scope does not cover integration with external health tracking apps, wearable devices, or thirdparty systems. 
- Mobile Application Development: At this stage, developing a mobile version of the tool is out of scope.

3. Activity Definition Estimation 

The project activities are defined based on the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and include tasks such as defining project objectives, identifying stakeholders, developing the project charter, and creating a detailed project schedule. Each activity is assigned to specific team members, ensuring clear ownership and responsibility. For example, data collection and validation tasks are handled by the Data Analyst, while the frontend and backend development are managed by the respective developers. The estimated duration for each activity ranges from 1 to 8 days, allowing for comprehensive planning and Gantt chart creation to track the progress.
