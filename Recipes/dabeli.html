<h1>What is Dabeli?</h1>
   <p style="font-size:25px;"> Whether you’re in Gujarat or Maharashtra, it is quite common for you to stumble upon the simple, yet absolutely filling and tasty snack Dabeli. Either on streets or at eateries or if you’re visiting a traditional Gujarati household. Also, the next time you’re onto a Vada Pav recipe, observe how similar it is to the Dabeli recipe. I would say, both are close cousins!
    
    So, you must be thinking as to what exactly the name of this dish means? In Gujarati language, Dabeli means ‘pressed.’ Which is obvious from the way this dish comes together, that is, the yummy Dabeli Masala laden potato mixture being stuffed or pressed between buttered pav (dinner rolls). </p>
 
    <h1>How to make Dabeli Masala?</h1>
    <p style="font-size:21px;">1. In a small skillet or frying pan, dry roast 1 dried red chili (seeds removed), ½ teaspoon cumin seeds, 2 to 3 cloves, ½ inch cinnamon and 1 teaspoon coriander seeds until fragrant and lightly toasted or roasted.
    Transfer the roasted spices to a plate and set aside to cool.You can’t see the coriander seeds here, as I have used my homemade roasted coriander powder while grinding the masala.</p>

    <p style="font-size:21px;">2. Add all the spices in a dry grinder or coffee grinder. Remove the stalk from the red chilli, before grinding it.</p>

    <p style="font-size:21px;">3. Grind to a fine powder. You will have some powder left even after adding it to Dabeli. You can use it in some vegetable or rice recipes.</p>
