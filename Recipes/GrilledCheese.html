    <h1>So here are my two golden rules for my very best grilled cheese:</h1>
    <p>1:-Use TWO types of cheese -Use mozzarella for stretch and another for flavour (gruyere and vintage cheddar are my favorites)</p>
    <p>2:-Give your sandwich press a miss. Use a pan on your stove! Just look at the superior golden buttery crust you get to bite into!</p>
    <h2><b>Then to take it from excellent to new heights of greatness….</b></h2>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">Grate cheese -If not using store bought pre-sliced cheese, grate the cheese using a standard box grater. As noted above, store bought pre-shredded cheese is coated with anti-caking agents which prevents it from melting properly.</p>

        <p style="font-size:18px;"> Butter both sides of each bread. Yes that’s right, all four sides. Trust me on this!</p>
        
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> Head start fry – Place the bread in a pre-heated heavy based skillet or non-stick fry pan over medium low heat. Let it lightly toast just for 1 minute. This will give this side of the bread a little extra toasty flavour as well as giving the cheese melting a head start – because we are going to flip the bread before piling the cheese on.</p>

        <p style="font-size:18px;"> Flip bread & cheese it! Turn one slice of bread then pile the cheese on top (any order). Place the other piece of bread on top with the hot toasted side in contact with the cheese.
       3 minutes – Press down lightly and cook for 3 minutes until the underside is a deep, even golden brown color. If it is browning too quickly, remove the pan from the stove, let it cool slightly and lower the heat.
        
        Turn, 3 minutes – Carefully turn the sandwich. Cook the other side for another 3 minutes until golden and crisp, and (most importantly!) the cheese is melted. Take a quick peek if you are unsure.</p>
